# Pocket Loom</br>
A cute pocket loom I designed, to weave anywhere & anytime. I am selling these pocket looms in a set [here](https://yylyy8luvvrgs2rl-82725798235.shopifypreview.com/products/pocket-loom-set-loom-stand?variant=47996612936027).</br>
</br>

First of all, thanks for either having purchased one of my pocket looms or you're interested in building your own. </br> 
Building this pocket loom was my summer project 2023, where I learned how to handle CAD software and actually having fun while doing it.
My goal was to make a travel loom that is super accessible and, to an extend, adjustable to one's needs.</br>
You can choose your desired length of the rod and your filament.</br>
The stand won't be available open-source.</br>

## Reprint</br>
A piece of your dear pocket loom broke? I bet it is one of those combs... well, here we are.</br>
Make sure to print either both STLs or see, which one you are missing (0-1 or 1-0).</br>
The teeth are aligned asymmetrically to each other. </br>
</br>
</br>
## Print Settings
The pieces have been printed on a Prusa Mini+ or a BambuLab P1S.</br>
The only parts that are more tricky are the teeth, make sure

Here are some information on the printer settings:</br>
</br>
Filament used: PolyTerra</br>
Infill Teeth: should be 90-95%</br>
Infill Bars: can be 50% or lighter</br>
Layer Height: 0.1-0.15mm</br>
Tip for needle: You can set the layer height smaller and allow ironing – I had good resuts on the Prusa, not so much on the Bambu Lab.
</br>
</br>
## Hardware
1x threaded rod M8, length of your choice. I used 25cm.</br>
4x M3x30 Screws</br>
4x M3 Nuts</br>
2x M8 Nuts</br>
2x M8 Washers (the ones that "lock" into the PLA)</br>

</br>
