# Pocket Loom</br>
A cute pocket loom I designed, to weave anywhere anytime.</br>

## Reprint</br>
A piece of your dear pocket loom broke? I bet it is one of those combs... well, here we are.</br>
Make sure to print either both STLs or see, which one you are missing.</br>
The teeth are aligned asymmetrically to each other. </br>
